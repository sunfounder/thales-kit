About Writing C/C++ Codes on Raspberry Pi Pico
=================================================

For beginners, writing code for Raspberry Pi Pico with Python, MicroPython or CircuitPython is an easy way.

What if you want to write in C/C++?

The Raspberry Pi provides C/C++ SDK for the Raspberry Pi Pico，which contains detailed `documentation <https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/raspberry-pi-pico-c-sdk.pdf>`_, 
but not suitable for beginners.

While Arduino is an excellent option for beginners who would like to write C/C++. But Arduino is still porting Pico for the Arduino IDE.

Luckily Earle F. Philhower, III published an unofficial support! He has developed the `Raspberry Pi Pico Arduino core <https://arduino-pico.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ to 
add support for the Raspberry Pi Pico to the Arduino IDE.


And then, using this repository, **tom'sHARDWARE** published a complete tutorial on setting up Arduino IDE for Raspberry Pi Pico on both Windows and Ubuntu.

You can also checkout this video `Video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XHh17cuH5E>`_.

If you can’t wait for the official one, try it out! As soon as Arduino officially release Raspberry Pi Pico port, we will update detailed lessons.
